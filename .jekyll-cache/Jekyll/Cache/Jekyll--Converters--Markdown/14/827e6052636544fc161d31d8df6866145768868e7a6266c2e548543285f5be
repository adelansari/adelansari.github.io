<p>If someone cycles past you up a steep hill looking serene and sweat-free. theyâ€™re either extremely tit or riding an electric bike. Electric. bikes still have pedals and can be ridden like conventional bicycles, but integrated meters add power and propulsion when needed. They range from bikes with small meters that assist when a cyclist is pedalling (known as pedelec) to models with throttles, which are able to operate like mopeds when the rider engages the meter.</p>
