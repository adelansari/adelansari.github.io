I"o<p>Connecting the wheels and tires to the car is a simple concept, but doing it in a manner which obtains good performance is a different matter altogether. In traveling around the circuit, the car experiences bumps from the track surface, and weight transfers from braking, accelerating, and cornering, and the design of the suspension geometry (relative angles and lengths) determines how the vehicle reacts to these forces. It has been a topic of interest to control vehicles and allow the wheels to move, adjust, and adapt to quickly changing road and driving conditions.
In this project, the aim was to design the front wheel suspension kinematics and components for a Formula Student race car with two different mechanisms (Double wishbone and McPherson suspension systems). The objective from the point view of kinematics is to design the linkage that fully determines the wheel path in specified manner when the wheel is having a vertical motion relative to the frame of car</p>

<p>The script written in <code class="highlighter-rouge">code1.m</code> creates a series of plots that show the relative count rate or relative subcritical multiplication factor (i.e. Mr(ρ) = C(ρ)/Co) versus subcriticality level, ρ.  In particular, it generate the following four plots with ρ starting at ρo = -10 dollars:</p>

<p>Mr vs ρ ,  1/Mr vs. ρ ,   Mr vs k   and  1/Mr vs. k</p>

<p>The curves are meaningful as they follow the theory and equations.
In the case of Mr vs ρ: Mr should increase exponentially as ρ increases and Mr → ∞as ρ→ 0.
In the case of 1/Mr vs ρ: Mr should decrease linearly as ρ increases, and 1/Mr →0 as ρ → 0.
In the case of Mr vs K: Mr should increase exponentially with k’s increase, and M → ∞ as k approaches 1.
In the case of 1/Mr vs K: Mr should decrease linearly with k’s increase, and 1/Mr → 0 as k → 1.
The 1/Mr vs ρ or 1/Mr vs k graphs are more informative, since the x-intercept represents criticality and is much easier to read.</p>

<p>The you should use the pkeqns_nofdbk.m function to</p>

<p>In order to simulate the behavior of a subcritical system with a series of positive step changes in reactivity, I wrote <code class="highlighter-rouge">pksim_test.m</code> code which uses the <code class="highlighter-rouge">pkeqns_nofdbk.m</code> code (written by J. R. White).  At each step, the level of subcriticality should be reduced by a factor of two until one gets close to critical  –  within -0.5 dollars should be sufficient to show the desired behavior here. The simulation starts at steady state subcritical with ρo = -10 dollars and add sufficient positive reactivity at each step to reduce the total reactivity by a factor of two each time.  Using the kinetics data for the UMLRR, including the source strength, S, and other parameters as obtained from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">kinetics_data.m</code> function file.  I used the <code class="highlighter-rouge">pksim_test.m</code> file as a starting point, making sure that the initial conditions set properly and that I get the tt and rhot vectors to mimic the desired sequence of step reactivity changes.</p>

<p>The Matlab code <code class="highlighter-rouge">pksim_test.m</code> was developed to simulate a steady, subcritical state with ρo = -10 dollars. Each time, sufficient positive reactivity was added at each step to reduce the total reactivity by a factor of two. By plotting P(t)/P_0 vs time, the sudden change in power were more understandable. The reactivity graphs show the effect of adding reactivity until the system reached near criticality. The result make sense as it is consistent with the theory. In case P_0 was chosen to be a larger number, the effect of the initial negative reactivity will be noticed (huge prompt drop).</p>
